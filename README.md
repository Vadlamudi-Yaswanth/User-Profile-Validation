## User-Profile-Validation
Description:
This project is designed to validate user profile details using Python.
It checks whether the user input such as name, phone number, and other details meet the required validation rules.
Purpose:
The main purpose of this project is to practice input validation in Python
How the Code Works:
- The program takes user input from the console.
- It validates each field using conditional statements.
- If the input is valid, it displays a User Profile is Valid.
- If the input is invalid, it shows User Profile is InValid.
Files in This Project:
- `Day1_Challenge.py` : Contains the Python code for user profile validation.
Output:
The program displays whether the entered user details are valid or not based on the given conditions.

# -Smart-ID-Credential-Validator
Purpose:
The main purpose of this project is to understand and practice string validation concepts in Python, such as checking characters, symbols, and conditions without using built-in validation functions.
The program accepts the following inputs from the user:
Student ID
Email ID
Password
Referral Code
Each input is validated based on specific rules.
If all validation rules are satisfied, the program displays APPROVED.
If any rule fails, the program displays REJECTED.
